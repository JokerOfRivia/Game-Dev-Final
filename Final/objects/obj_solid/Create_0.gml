	Welcome to the actor/solid system!
	
	In the actor/solid system, all actors collide with "Solids." Objects like platforms or 
	terrain should inherit from this object. Solids do not collide with each other, but 
	there's no rule saying they can't move!
	
	Also, you can place obj_solid in-game on its own as a way to create invisible walls.
